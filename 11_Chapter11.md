## Epiphany ##

As you've carried on with your pantser-writing, you might have noticed that the story you're creating feels disconnected from itself. You're getting bogged down in details, trying to piece together a plot so that it makes sense while fearing that you might have bitten off more than you can chew. It's times like these when you need to take a step back and assess things to make sense of your writing. Luckily for you, we have some useful tips that can help you stay on track.

## Resolution ##

Never fear, dear reader, for help is at hand! To make sense of your writing as you go, you first need to take a step back and gain some perspective. Try asking yourself the following:

- Who is the protagonist or the main character?
- What are their goals?
- Who or what is preventing them from achieving those goals?
- What is the setting?
- What is the tone or mood of the story?

Once you have the answers to these questions, you can start to narrow down your plot and make sense of your writing as you go. You'll find that the characters you're creating and the plot itself start to become clearer, and the direction you need to take your story in should reveal itself.

And there you have it, dear readers. Another chapter close in your process of pantsing your way to the end of your novel. Keep these tips firmly in your mind, and before you know it, you'll have a completed draft in your hands. Keep writing and don't be afraid to take risks!
