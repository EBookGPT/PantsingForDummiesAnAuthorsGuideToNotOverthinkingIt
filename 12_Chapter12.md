## Chapter 12: Editing and Revising Without Losing Your Pantsing Approach

Ah, the sweet satisfaction of reaching the end of your first draft. You've been pantsing your way through your manuscript, trusting your intuition and letting your ideas flow. Your fingers have danced over the keyboard, and somehow, a story has emerged.

Now what? How do you revise and edit without losing the magic that came from pantsing in the first place? Fear not, dear reader, for we have gathered the best tips and tricks for maintaining your pantsing approach during the editing process. 

To help us in this endeavor, we have a special guest: the master of horror himself, Stephen King. He is a firm believer in the power of pantsing, and he has agreed to share some of his editing strategies with us.

But before we dive into those, let's review the importance of staying true to your original vision while refining your manuscript.

## 11. Making Sense of Your Writing as You Go: Recap

In our previous chapter, we discussed how to make sense of your writing as you go. We explored different techniques for organizing your thoughts and keeping track of your ideas, so that you could avoid feeling lost or overwhelmed when pantsing.

Remember that when pantsing, it's important to keep a sense of direction and purpose, even if you don't know exactly where your story is headed. One way to do this is to create a loose outline or roadmap, so that you have a general idea of where you want to end up.

Now let's move on to editing and revising.

## Stephen King's Advice on Editing and Revising

Stephen King is a firm believer in pantsing, seeing it as a way to unlock the subconscious mind and allow ideas to flow freely onto the page. But he also recognizes the importance of editing and revising, and he has a few tips for how to approach these tasks without losing the spontaneity and creativity of pantsing.

First, King emphasizes the value of taking a break between drafts. After finishing a first draft, put it away for a few weeks or even months, and work on something else. This will give you some distance from your work and allow you to approach it with fresh eyes.

Second, when you do come back to your manuscript, try to maintain the sense of discovery and excitement that came with pantsing. Don't be afraid to make big changes, even if it means throwing out entire chapters or characters.

Third, be mindful of pacing and structure. As you read through your manuscript, ask yourself if each scene moves the story forward and if the overall structure makes sense. But don't get too bogged down in details; allow yourself to be flexible and open to changes.

Remember, editing and revising is a process, and it can be just as rewarding as pantsing. By staying true to your original vision while still being open to change and improvement, you can create a polished manuscript that still maintains the magic of pantsing. 

Let's put these tips into action as we move forward with editing and revising our manuscripts.
